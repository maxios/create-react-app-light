## create-react-app-light

The purpose is to have as tiny and basic react-redux boilerplate as possible.

Currently includes:
- redux
- redux-saga
- sass
- i18n (translation infra)
- jest
- babel
- eslint
- webpack
- hot reload
- webpack-dev-server

To be continued: 
- react router

And much more..
